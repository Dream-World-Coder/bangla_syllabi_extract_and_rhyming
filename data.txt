# lines_to_generate: int = 2, not to be as param
# first check the self.pattern,
# chhondo, extracted_pattern = self.determine_chhondo(self.pattern)
# the sentence will have len(extracted_pattern) words [for now, later i will wrap a sentence in 2-4 lines, for more poetic feel]
# so make the sentence with the grammar,
# eg final sentence = <NOUN> <NOUN> <VERB> <ADJ> <NOUN>
# now we know the matra and chhondo, but as we also have access to POS now, we will look por word.POS and match the resultant sentence
# this is the only difference from generate_random_poem, that is consideration of the word.POS alongside word.totalMatra.chhondo
# NOW MAKE IT, CAREFULLY OBSERVE THE generate_random_poem
